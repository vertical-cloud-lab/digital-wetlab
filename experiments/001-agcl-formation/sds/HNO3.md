# SDS Summary: Nitric Acid (HNO₃)

- **CAS No.:** 7697-37-2
- **Molecular Weight:** 63.01 g/mol
- **Form in experiment:** Dilute byproduct in solution (Variant B: AgNO₃ + HCl → AgCl + HNO₃)

## GHS Classification (Concentrated)

- Oxidizing liquids, Category 3 (H272)
- Corrosive to metals, Category 1 (H290)
- Skin corrosion, Category 1A (H314)
- Serious eye damage, Category 1 (H318)
- Acute toxicity, inhalation, Category 3 (H331)

**Signal Word:** Danger

> **Note:** In this experiment, HNO₃ is produced as a dilute byproduct
> (≤0.1 M in 20 µL wells), not handled as a concentrated reagent. The
> hazard severity at this dilution is significantly reduced.

## Hazard Statements (Concentrated)

- H272: May intensify fire; oxidizer
- H290: May be corrosive to metals
- H314: Causes severe skin burns and eye damage
- H331: Toxic if inhaled

## Physical Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Appearance | Colorless liquid (dilute) |
| Odor | Pungent (concentrated); minimal at dilute concentrations |
| Vapor pressure | Volatile (concentrated); reduced at dilute concentrations |
| Boiling point | 83°C (concentrated, 68%); ~100°C (dilute) |
| Density | 1.51 g/cm³ (concentrated); ~1.0 g/cm³ (dilute) |
| Flammability | Not flammable |

## First Aid

- **Inhalation:** Move to fresh air immediately; seek medical attention
- **Skin:** Remove contaminated clothing; rinse with water for ≥15 min
- **Eyes:** Rinse with water for ≥15 min; remove contact lenses; seek immediate medical attention
- **Ingestion:** Rinse mouth; do NOT induce vomiting; seek immediate medical attention

## PPE

- Nitrile or neoprene gloves
- Splash goggles
- Face shield (for concentrated)
- Lab coat
- Fume hood (for concentrated; dilute byproduct in sealed wells is low risk)

## Storage

- Store in corrosion-resistant container
- Keep tightly closed in well-ventilated area
- Keep away from combustible materials, bases, organic materials

## Waste Disposal

- Collect in acid waste container
- Neutralize if allowed by local protocols
- Do not discharge to drains
- Follow institutional hazardous waste procedures
