- Skin corrosion, Category 1B (H314)
- Serious eye damage, Category 1 (H318)
- Specific target organ toxicity — single exposure, Category 3 (H335)

**Signal Word:** Danger

## Hazard Statements

- H290: May be corrosive to metals
- H314: Causes severe skin burns and eye damage
- H335: May cause respiratory irritation

## Precautionary Statements

- P261: Avoid breathing mist/vapors/spray

## Physical Properties (1 M Solution)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Appearance | Colorless liquid |
| Odor | Pungent, irritating |
| pH | < 1 |
| Vapor pressure | Volatile — produces HCl fumes |
| Boiling point | ~100°C (dilute solution) |
| Density | ~1.02 g/cm³ at 20°C |
| Flammability | Not flammable |

> **Key point:** Even at 1 M concentration, HCl solution produces irritating
> fumes. **A fume hood is required** for handling.

## First Aid

- **Inhalation:** Move to fresh air immediately; seek medical attention
- **Skin:** Remove contaminated clothing; rinse with water for ≥15 min; seek medical attention
