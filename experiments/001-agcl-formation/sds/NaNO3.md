## Hazards

- **Oxidizer** — may intensify fire if in contact with combustible materials
- Eye irritant
- At the dilute concentrations produced in this experiment (micromolar in 20 µL wells), hazards are minimal

## First Aid

- **Inhalation:** Move to fresh air
- **Skin:** Wash with soap and water
- **Eyes:** Rinse with water for several minutes; seek medical attention if irritation persists
- **Ingestion:** Rinse mouth; drink water; seek medical advice if unwell

## PPE

- Safety goggles
- Lab coat
- Gloves

## Storage

- Keep container tightly closed
- Store in cool, dry, well-ventilated area
- Keep away from heat and combustible materials

## Waste Disposal

- Not classified as hazardous waste at low concentrations
- In this experiment, will be collected together with the silver-containing waste stream
- Follow local regulations
