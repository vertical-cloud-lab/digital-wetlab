# Safety Data Sheet (SDS) Summaries

This directory contains SDS summaries for all chemicals and reaction products
involved in Experiment 001 (AgCl precipitation). These are **summaries
extracted from manufacturer SDS documents** — always refer to the full
official SDS for complete safety information.

## Notes

- SDS documents are living documents updated by manufacturers. The summaries
  here were compiled in February 2026. Always check the manufacturer's website
  for the most current version.
- For the actual experiment, the concentrations used are dilute (0.1 M AgNO₃,
  1 M NaCl or HCl), which generally reduce hazard severity compared to
  concentrated or solid forms.
- All chemicals should be procured from BYU Chem Stores to maintain proper
  chain of custody and institutional safety compliance.
