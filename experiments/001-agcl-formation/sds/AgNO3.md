# SDS Summary: Silver Nitrate (AgNO₃)

- **CAS No.:** 7761-88-8
- **Molecular Weight:** 169.87 g/mol
- **Form used in experiment:** 0.1 M aqueous solution

## GHS Classification

- Oxidizing solids, Category 2 (H272)
- Skin corrosion, Category 1A (H314)
- Serious eye damage, Category 1 (H318)
- Acute toxicity, oral, Category 5 (H303)
- Hazardous to the aquatic environment, acute, Category 1 (H400)
- Hazardous to the aquatic environment, long-term, Category 1 (H410)

**Signal Word:** Danger

## Hazard Statements

- H272: May intensify fire; oxidizer
- H303: May be harmful if swallowed
- H314: Causes severe skin burns and eye damage
- H318: Causes serious eye damage
- H410: Very toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects

## Physical Properties (0.1 M Solution)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Appearance | Colorless liquid |
| Odor | Odorless |
| pH | ~5 (0.1 M) |
| Vapor pressure | **Negligible** at room temperature (equivalent to water) |
| Boiling point | ~100°C (dilute aqueous solution) |
| Density | ~1.0 g/cm³ |
| Flammability | Not flammable |

> **Key point:** Silver nitrate in aqueous solution does not produce fumes
> or hazardous vapors at room temperature. The vapor pressure is negligible,
> and the solution is odorless. No fume hood is required for handling 0.1 M
> solution in small volumes with standard PPE.

## First Aid

- **Inhalation:** Move to fresh air; seek medical attention if symptoms occur
- **Skin:** Remove contaminated clothing; wash with water for ≥15 min; seek medical attention
- **Eyes:** Rinse with water for ≥15 min; remove contact lenses; seek immediate medical attention
- **Ingestion:** Rinse mouth; do NOT induce vomiting; seek medical attention

## PPE

- Nitrile gloves
- Splash goggles
- Lab coat
- Adequate ventilation (fume hood not required for dilute solutions)

## Storage

- Store in tightly closed container
- Protect from light (photosensitive)
- Keep in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area

## Waste Disposal

- Collect as heavy metal waste
- Do not discharge to drains or environment
- Follow institutional hazardous waste procedures
