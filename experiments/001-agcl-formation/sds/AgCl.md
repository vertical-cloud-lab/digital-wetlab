# SDS Summary: Silver Chloride (AgCl)

- **CAS No.:** 7783-90-6
- **Molecular Weight:** 143.32 g/mol
- **Form in experiment:** White, curdy precipitate (reaction product)

## GHS Classification

- Corrosive to metals, Category 1 (H290)
- Hazardous to the aquatic environment, acute, Category 1 (H400)
- Hazardous to the aquatic environment, long-term, Category 1 (H410)

**Signal Word:** Warning

## Hazard Statements

- H290: May be corrosive to metals
- H410: Very toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects

## Physical Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Appearance | White solid (curdy precipitate when freshly formed) |
| Odor | Odorless |
| Melting point | 455°C |
| Solubility in water | Practically insoluble (Ksp = 1.77 × 10⁻¹⁰ at 25°C) |
| Photosensitivity | Darkens on exposure to light (decomposes to Ag metal) |
| Flammability | Not flammable |

## Hazards

- **Primary hazard is environmental** — very toxic to aquatic life
- Low acute toxicity to humans
- May be corrosive to metals (releases Cl⁻ slowly in presence of moisture)
- Thermal decomposition may release hydrogen chloride gas and silver/silver oxides

## First Aid

- **Inhalation:** Move to fresh air
- **Skin:** Remove contaminated clothing; rinse with water
- **Eyes:** Rinse with water for several minutes; seek medical attention if irritation persists
- **Ingestion:** Rinse mouth; drink water; consult physician if feeling unwell

## PPE

- Safety goggles
- Lab coat
- Gloves

## Storage

- Keep in original, corrosion-resistant container
- Store tightly closed in dry, well-ventilated area
- Protect from light (photosensitive)

## Waste Disposal

- Collect as **heavy metal waste** (silver-containing)
- Do not discharge to drains or environment
- Follow institutional hazardous waste procedures
