## 6. Recommendations for US–German Collaboration

When German colleagues serve as **PIs or co-PIs**:
- **NSF-DFG Lead Agency** (§2.1) is the primary mechanism — designed exactly for this scenario
- **DMREF** (§4.3) has an explicit NSF-DFG bilateral track
- Budget on the US side is a standard CHE grant; DFG funds the German side independently

When German colleagues serve as **collaborators** (not funded by the US grant):
- Most NSF and DOE programs allow unfunded international collaborators via letters of collaboration
- Include German collaborators on your **CAREER** or **CHE-DRP** proposal this way
- **NSF IRES** (§2.2) can fund student exchanges to the German partner institution

**German-side funding for collaborators:**
- DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) — through the Lead Agency mechanism or independent proposals
- DAAD (Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst) — for student/researcher exchanges
- Alexander von Humboldt Foundation — for senior researcher visits and fellowships

## 8. General Tips

1. **Contact program officers** before submitting — they can confirm fit and suggest the best program
2. **Stack small grants** early — ACS PRF + Dreyfus/Cottrell provide runway while CAREER is in review
3. **German collaborators can appear on most proposals** via unfunded letters of collaboration
4. **Frame the project** around whichever tier best matches the program:
   - Data generation (Tier 1) → CMI, BES, ACS PRF
   - Benchmarking (Tier 2) → CAREER, PCL Test Bed
   - Novel algorithms (Tier 3) → CDS&E, CAREER, DARPA
5. **Leverage BYU's teaching culture** — the CAREER education plan and Dreyfus/Cottrell nominations are strengthened by genuine commitment to undergraduate research and education
6. **Highlight the benchmarking angle** — funding agencies increasingly value reproducible AI evaluation frameworks
